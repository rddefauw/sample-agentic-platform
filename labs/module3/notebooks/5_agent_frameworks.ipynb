    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll examine how different agent frameworks implement autonomous agents, focusing specifically on LangChain/LangGraph, PydanticAI, and CrewAI. We'll explore how these frameworks handle orchestration, tool use, and agent coordination while leveraging our existing abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "* Get hands on with high-level frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph, PydanticAI, and CrewAI\n",
    "* Learn how to integrate our tool calling, memory, and conversation abstractions with each framework\n",
    "* Implement examples showing how to maintain consistent interfaces across frameworks\n",
    "* Understand when to use each framework based on their strengths and application needs\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you'll understand how to build on top of these frameworks while reusing your existing code, allowing you to choose the right framework for each use case without starting from scratch."

    "Using LangGraph / LangChain (or any framework) makes sense in scenarios like this. It does exactly what we need it to do out of the box. However, it has it's own types (messages), it's own model invocation implementation, etc.. You can use them, but it creates a 1-way door decision. If you need to build something custom, use different framework, swap out a long term memory implementation, etc.. it will be very painful to undo the tight coupling of a framework.\n",

It's a little extra work but provides a lot more flexibility. As things become more standard, this might become less of a problem. But for now, the best way to create 2-way doors is to use your own types. \n",
