    "# Agentic Platform: Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab introduces the concept of Agent Evaluation. Effective evaluation frameworks are essential for measuring, comparing and improving agent performance across different implementations and configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to evaluating agentic systems, ranging from simple to complex. In this lab we'll focus on two evaluation metrics\n",
    "* Assertion based evaluations\n",
    "* Step-based procedural analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The most sophisticated evaluation systems incorporate human feedback loops and nuanced assessments of agent behavior. While powerful, these systems often require significant infrastructure and human resources to implement effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we'll explore a couple approaches to an evaluation framework focused on two key metrics:\n",
    "1. Task success rate - measuring whether agents complete their assigned tasks correctly\n",
    "2. Steps to completion - analyzing the efficiency of agents by tracking the number of steps required to achieve success\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are essentially test cases. Sometimes we're looking for exact answers (What's the capital of France? -> Paris). Sometimes the evaluation criteria is qualitative data (did the agent provide a recipe that was gluten free?)\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide a straightforward but powerful foundation for comparing agent performance across different models, prompting strategies, and tool configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First lets modify a couple agents we built in the previous labs."

The most important thing in evaluation is to identify what metrics to select and what make sense for your usecase. If a framework provides it, great. If not, you often times have to build your own test harness. \n",
